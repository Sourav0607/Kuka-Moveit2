# Kuka MoveIt2 Path Planning

This project demonstrates path planning and manipulation for the KUKA KR10 R1420 robot using MoveIt2 and ROS 2.

## Project Overview

- Implemented **path planning** and robot manipulation using **MoveIt2**.
- Used **KUKA KR10 R1420** robot model STL files to build a detailed robot description.
- Created the **URDF model** of the robot, including all necessary controllers.
- Developed **MoveIt2 launch files** for planning and visualization.
- Successfully manipulated the robot in **RViz**, performing planned trajectories and motions.

## Features

- Complete URDF model based on downloaded STL files.
- Integration with MoveIt2 for motion planning.
- Controllers configured for robot actuation.
- RViz visualization of robot motion and planning scene.
